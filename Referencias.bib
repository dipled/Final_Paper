    abstract = {The problem of disjoint sets, also known as union-find, consists in maintaining a partition of a finite set within a data structure. This structure provides two operations: a function find returning the class of an element and a function union merging two classes. An optimal and imperative solution is known since 1975. However, the imperative nature of this data structure may be a drawback when it is used in a backtracking algorithm. This paper details the implementation of a persistent union-find data structure as efficient as its imperative counterpart. To achieve this result, our solution makes heavy use of imperative features and thus it is a significant example of a data structure whose side effects are safely hidden behind a persistent interface. To strengthen this last claim, we also detail a formalization using the Coq proof assistant which shows both the correctness of our solution and its observational persistence.},

abstract="We present a formalization of a so-called paraconsistent logic that avoids the catastrophic explosiveness of inconsistency in classical logic. The paraconsistent logic has a countably infinite number of non-classical truth values. We show how to use the proof assistant Isabelle to formally prove theorems in the logic as well as meta-theorems about the logic. In particular, we formalize a meta-theorem that allows us to reduce the infinite number of truth values to a finite number of truth values, for a given formula, and we use this result in a formalization of a small case study.",

    abstract = {Three-valued logics arise in several fields of computer science, both inspired by concrete problems (such as in the management of the null value in databases) and theoretical considerations. Several three-valued logics have been defined. They differ by their choice of basic connectives, hence also from a syntactic and proof-theoretic point of view. Different interpretations of the third truth value have also been suggested. They often carry an epistemic flavor. In this work, relationships between logical connectives on three-valued functions are explored. Existing theorems of functional completeness have laid bare some of these links, based on specific connectives. However we try to draw a map of such relationships between conjunctions, negations and implications that extend Boolean ones. It turns out that all reasonable connectives can be defined from a few of them and so all known three-valued logics appear as a fragment of only one logic. These results can be instrumental when choosing, for each application context, the appropriate fragment where the basic connectives make full sense, based on the appropriate meaning of the third truth-value.}

    abstract = {In 2016 Béziau, introduce a restricted notion of paraconsistency, the so-called genuine paraconsistency. A logic is genuine paraconsistent if it rejects the laws φ,¬φ ⊢ ψ and ⊢ ¬(φ ∧ ¬φ). In that paper the author analyzes, among the three-valued logics, which of them satisfy this property. If we consider multiple-conclusion consequence relations, the dual properties of those above mentioned are ⊢ φ,¬φ and ¬(ψ∨¬ψ) ⊢. We call genuine paracomplete logics those rejecting the mentioned properties. We present here an analysis of the three-valued genuine paracomplete logics.}

    abstract = {Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},
