            ``\textit{We loved our country as much as they; we went courageously into every action; but also we distinguished the false from true, 
            we had suddenly learned to see. And we saw that there was nothing of their world left. We were all at once terribly alone; and alone we 
            must see it through}'' (Enrich Maria Remarque -- All Quiet on The Western Front, [1928])
